AJAX Hands On
Requirements
For this project, you are going to use AJAX to create a web page that displays a famous historical figure, Einstein, and his information. Follow the below requirements. All JavaScript code should live within the script.js file.

Within the einstein.json file, create a json object that includes the following keys:
name with Einsteins full name
birthday with Einsteins birth date
bio that includes his full bio
Create a function that will show the name and birthday of Einstein when the page is loaded using the einstein.json file.
Create a button that will call another function and will display his full bio when clicked.
Use the DOM to display the bio
Don't forget the necessary HTML code to allow this all to work!
You have to run http-server to correctly see this working or you will get an error.
